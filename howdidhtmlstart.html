<h1>How Did HTML 5 Start?</h1>
<p>
HTML5 is a cooperation between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</br>
WHATWG was working with web forms and applications, and W3C was working with XHTML 2.0. In 2006, they decided to cooperate and create a new version of HTML.</br></br>
Some rules for HTML5 were established:</p>
<ul>
<li>New features should be based on HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript</li>
<li>Reduce the need for external plugins (like Flash)</li>
<li>Better error handling</li>
<li>More markup to replace scripting</li>
<li>HTML5 should be device independent</li>
<li>The development process should be visible to the public</li>
</ul>
